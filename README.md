Novelty: the function Arc3D(p0, p1) plots an arc in the unit sphere that connects the points p0 and p1

inspired by the answer: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/329749/draw-an-arc-in-3d-coordinate-system
# To do:
- [x] Constrict the lines on the surface of the sphere
- [ ] Add more vertices
- [ ] Try to avoid local minima and select stratigical initial conditions
- [ ] Maybe let the user select the number of points and where to be placed
- [ ] Map method to Google earth
